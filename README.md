**vuba** (formerly **cvu**) is an easy to use library for constructing [`OpenCV`](https://opencv.org/) HighGUI interfaces.

We developed this library to make coding up computer vision interfaces fast and efficient, allowing users to focus on their given application and bypass the challenges associated with developing a working user interface. We have since extended this to other areas of the [`OpenCV`](https://opencv.org/) library, writing wrappers where we feel the reduction in code verbosity improves both readability and reduces complexity in codebases. 

Currently the library is split up into three modules:

* [**gui**](https://github.com/EmbryoPhenomics/vuba/blob/main/vuba/gui.py) - [`OpenCV`](https://opencv.org/) HighGUI constructors, for both individual/multiple images and video sequences. These all share the same base constructor class, where the interfaces are constructed through a series of decorators. This enables users to create complex interfaces through a simple, declarative API.
* [**imio**](https://github.com/EmbryoPhenomics/vuba/blob/main/vuba/imio.py) - Image readers and writers for handling various image formats. Note that regardless of format, the handlers share the same API.
* [**ops**](https://github.com/EmbryoPhenomics/vuba/blob/main/vuba/ops.py)- Image operations, from simple drawing functions to contour filters and mask constructors.

This library is still in active development and so we welcome feedback on any aspect of **vuba**.
