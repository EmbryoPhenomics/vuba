# Examples

There a variety of examples here each showing recipes for usage of the functions in the **cvu** package. These are split into the following categories:

* [**reading**](https://github.com/EmbryoPhenomics/cvu/tree/main/examples/reading)
	* Reading in footage, either from separate images or video files. 
	* Creating both in-memory and out-of-core containers for frames.
* [**writing**](https://github.com/EmbryoPhenomics/cvu/tree/main/examples/writing)
	* Writing images/frames into individual images or video files, from both video files and separate images.
* [**interfaces**](https://github.com/EmbryoPhenomics/cvu/tree/main/examples/interfaces)
	* Example recipes showing usage of the OpenCV HighGUI constructors
* [**image_operations**](https://github.com/EmbryoPhenomics/cvu/tree/main/examples/image_operations)
	* Examples of drawing functions
	* Basic examples of contour filters
	* Integration of contour filters into OpenCV HighGUI's
