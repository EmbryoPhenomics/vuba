Vuba 
====

Vuba (formerly **cvu**) is an easy to use library for constructing OpenCV_ HighGUI interfaces. We developed this library to make coding up computer vision interfaces fast and efficient, allowing users to focus on their given application and bypass the challenges associated with developing a working user interface.
